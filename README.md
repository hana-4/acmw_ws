#  Rock-Paper-Scissors with AI   

This project implements an interactive **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for hand gesture classification and **OpenCV** for real-time image capture. It was developed as part of a **computer vision workshop** to introduce participants to deep learning concepts and real-time image processing.

**Workshop Notebook:** [computer_vision_workshop.ipynb](computer_vision_workshop.ipynb)


## Overview  
- The game detects hand gestures using a webcam and classifies them as **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.  
- Classification is done by a CNN model, trained on labeled hand gesture images.  
- The game determines the winner based on traditional Rock Paper Scissors rules.  

##  Technologies used 
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (for real-time image capture)  
- **PyTorch** (for deep learning model)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive development)
